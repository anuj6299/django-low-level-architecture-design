Django is a nice framework to build large projects. But if you are not keeping you code clean and modular from starting, it becomes nightmare after you are done writing thousands of lines of code. So, I have designed a very low level architecture after learning from my mistakes and experience.

Please feel free to add more inputs. Happy coding :)
